          “Even with an extensive amount of responsibility, Ryan is someone I can always rely on. He has a vast array of knowledge, especially pertaining to technology; he’s able to synthesize the most complex concepts into plain English. He’s an incredibly thorough manager while also being a delightful person to work with. One of my favorite attributes about Ryan is his ability to challenge an idea or concept in a way that makes everyone think about it from a different perspective, and ultimately, create a better version.”
